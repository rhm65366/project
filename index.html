		Ever since I can remember I have always been huge Georgia Bulldogs fan because both of my parents went there and I am from Atlanta. As a kid some of my best memories are going to the football games and walking around the campus knowing that that was the school I wanted to attend.

		Once I got to high school though, I realized how hard of a task it would be to get in and although I worked very hard for those four years, I still was not able to get in. I knew though that this would not be the end of the road though. I decided that I would attend Auburn and try to get into Georgia the following year.

		<p>
		I chose the <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/">University of Auburn</a> because I had family there, being that my father grew up there and my grandfather was a professor there. This gave me a sense of home and felt very comfortable there. I worked very hard for one year to get my GPA up and then finally was able to apply again.

		I am thankful for my time at Auburn and the friends I made there, but once I found out I had been accepted to Georgia I was ecstatic and knew I was going to be able to attend my dream school. I am excited for my future at the University of Georgia and am ready to start a new life chapter here.
